# FameTech DevOps Lab – Filesystem, Logs, Archives & Storage Management

> This lab simulates real-world DevOps responsibilities involving directory structuring, secure log handling, permission hardening, and Linux storage management — critical for supporting CI/CD, monitoring agents, and backup strategies in production.

---

## About This Project

This hands-on lab was executed as part of my DevOps role at FameTech NYC, simulating work for CloudVerse Corp. I was responsible for provisioning secure log directories for Jenkins and automation tools, managing storage mounts, enforcing group-based access policies, and automating archiving and recovery tasks.

> Verified experience through project-based simulation at FameTech.

## Ticket: CV-DEVOPS-101

As part of CloudVerse’s CI/CD infrastructure hardening effort, you’ve been assigned to:

- Create secure directories under `/opt` and `/var/log`
- Apply user/group-based ownership and permission controls
- Archive logs with tar and zip, then simulate recovery
- Simulate block storage and mount it persistently using `/etc/fstab`

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Secure Directory Structure

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cloudverse/{jenkins,ansible,monitoring}
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/cloudverse/{jenkins,ansible,monitoring}
```

---

### Step 2: Apply Ownership and Permissions

```bash
sudo chown -R jenkins:devops /opt/cloudverse/jenkins /var/log/cloudverse/jenkins
sudo chown -R ansible:devops /opt/cloudverse/ansible /var/log/cloudverse/ansible
sudo chown -R root:devops /opt/cloudverse/monitoring /var/log/cloudverse/monitoring

sudo chmod -R 750 /opt/cloudverse/
sudo chmod -R 770 /var/log/cloudverse/
```

---

### Step 3: Simulate Log Generation

```bash
echo "Build success at $(date)" | sudo tee -a /var/log/cloudverse/jenkins/build.log
echo "Deployed at $(date)" | sudo tee -a /var/log/cloudverse/ansible/deploy.log
echo "Heartbeat OK $(date)" | sudo tee -a /var/log/cloudverse/monitoring/agent.log
```

---

### Step 4: Archive Logs and Simulate Rotation

```bash
sudo tar -czvf /opt/cloudverse/jenkins_logs_$(date +%F).tar.gz /var/log/cloudverse/jenkins/
sudo tar -czvf /opt/cloudverse/ansible_logs_$(date +%F).tar.gz /var/log/cloudverse/ansible/

sudo find /var/log/cloudverse/jenkins/ -type f -name "*.log" -delete
sudo find /var/log/cloudverse/ansible/ -type f -name "*.log" -delete
```

---

### Step 5: Restore Logs from Archive

```bash
sudo tar -xzvf /opt/cloudverse/jenkins_logs_*.tar.gz -C /var/log/cloudverse/
sudo tar -xzvf /opt/cloudverse/ansible_logs_*.tar.gz -C /var/log/cloudverse/
```

---

### Step 6: Simulate Block Storage with Loop Device

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/fake-disk.img bs=1M count=1024
sudo losetup /dev/loop10 /fake-disk.img
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop10
sudo mkdir /mnt/devopsdata
sudo mount /dev/loop10 /mnt/devopsdata
df -h | grep devopsdata
```

---

### Step 7: Make Mount Persistent with /etc/fstab

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/loop10
```

Edit `/etc/fstab`:

```
UUID=<copied-uuid> /mnt/devopsdata ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

## Interview Questions and Answers

| Question                                                      | Answer                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How do you secure log directories in multi-user environments? | Use user\:group ownership and restrict access with chmod 750 or 770   |
| What’s the purpose of /etc/fstab in Linux?                    | It enables persistent mounting of storage devices after reboot        |
| Why simulate storage with loop devices?                       | For testing without physical disks, common in lab and staging setups  |
| How would you implement log rotation?                         | Use `logrotate` or manual archiving and cleanup with `tar` and `find` |
| What’s the risk of using chmod 777 on logs?                   | Full access to all users, violating security and compliance standards |

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- Jenkins job logs must be retained securely to prevent leakage of build secrets
- Monitoring logs are critical for real-time alerting and compliance audits
- Log archiving helps retain space and enable rollback/debug in prod environments
- Persistent storage for CI/CD agents or containers ensures data isn't lost on reboot

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                            | Resolution                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Editing /etc/fstab but not testing with `mount -a` | Always test the entry before reboot          |
| Assigning wrong permissions like 777               | Use least-privilege model: 750 or 770        |
| Forgetting to create mount directory               | Always `mkdir` target directory before mount |

## Story: From Task to Production Impact

In real-world DevOps, careless log handling or missing mount entries can lead to security breaches, system crashes, and failed audits. In this lab, I acted as the DevOps engineer responsible for enforcing security through structured filesystem controls and reliable storage provisioning — essential practices before scaling to production-grade infrastructure.
